# Data-mining-project

Dataset is about the significant earthquakes occurred since 1965-2016.
The project was developed in R a open source software.
The dataset has more than 23000 rows and about 20 attributes.
In the project I tried to analyse the data set and plot them taking different attributes into account each time.
One can download the dataset and load it into R and can run the code provided.
Dataset could be access from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database
